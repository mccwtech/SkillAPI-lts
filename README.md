# SkillAPI-lts
SkillAPI is a Minecraft Bukkit plugin aiming to provide an easy code API and skill editor for all server owners to create unique and fully custom classes and skills.

This project is originally by [Eniripsa96](https://github.com/Eniripsa96/SkillAPI)
Which has been stopped maintaining the origin repo at 2019 <br>
The second maintainer [Sentropic](https://github.com/Sentropic/SkillAPI-s) continued
the development with the new code name SkillAPI-s till 2021 <br>
Today, the third maintainer [PROMCTEAM](https://github.com/promcteam/proskillapi) has taken over the project
and continue the development and upgrade to the latest Minecraft version
<br><br>
Unfortunately, It is too hard to maintain those old Minecraft versions while keeping the latest features <br>
PROMCTEAM has decided to drop the 1.12.2 support, which many server include our own network still using <br>
Thats why we forked the project and revert the changes to the MCCore replacement <br>
We will continue pulling latest features and maintain SkillAPI for 1.12.2 as long as possible

Anyways, thanks for all of the contributors at above, without any of them, SkillAPI would never
been such popular and powerful.

## LTS dynamic editor
Currently, the dynamic editor is working with PROMCTEAM's fork, we will keep using the same editor untilthere is any compatibility issue
